this application was made to familiarize with the popular programming language python as well as manipulating datastructures in the form of xml

since the focus was more on the back-end data driven application, the front-end user interfaceis lacking and would need to be improved if it is to be expanded

additional missing features which could be added in the future:
- option to edit individual entries
- show the remaining time of the current activity, as well as automatically showing the next activity once it has ended
- formatting the schedual sheet to fit a more tabular style, visualized via the timestamps
